My thesis focuses on fine-grained object classification via deep metric learning under the supervision of Prof. Dr. A. AydÄ±n Alatan. Before that, I received my two Bachelor of Science degrees with high honors in both EEE and Physics departments from METU. My research interests include but are not limited to computer vision, deep metric learning, and graph signal processing.
