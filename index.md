### Bio
I am currently working for my Master's degree in the field of electrical and electronics engineering (EEE) at [Middle East Technical University (METU)](https://www.metu.edu.tr/), located in Ankara, Turkey as well as have been working in the [ASELSAN](https://www.aselsan.com.tr/) [Research Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSfxlxbzGqc&ab_channel=AselsanTV) as a research engineer to gain experience in topics such as computer vision and deep learning since 2017. My thesis focuses on fine-grained image retrieval via deep metric learning under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. A. AydÄ±n Alatan](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/personel/aydin-alatan). Before that, I received my two Bachelor of Science degrees with high honors in both EEE and Physics departments from METU. My research interests include but are not limited to computer vision, deep metric learning, and graph signal processing.
