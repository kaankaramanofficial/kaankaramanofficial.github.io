### About
I am currently working as a PhD student at the [Institute for Computational Science](https://www.ics.uzh.ch/en/) at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html),supervised by [Prof. Dr. Jan Dirk Wegner](https://www.ics.uzh.ch/en/research/research-groups/Jan-Dirk-Wegner.html), and I am affiliated with the [EcoVision Lab](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/ecovision.html), located in [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), since 2021. I received my Master's degree in the field of Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) at [Middle East Technical University](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) (METU), located in Ankara, Turkey as well as have been working in the [ASELSAN](https://www.aselsan.com.tr/) [Research Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSfxlxbzGqc&ab_channel=AselsanTV) as a research engineer to gain experience in topics such as computer vision and deep learning during my MS studies. My [Master thesis](https://open.metu.edu.tr/handle/11511/89584) focuses on fine-grained image retrieval via deep metric learning under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. A. Aydın Alatan](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/personel/aydin-alatan). Previously, I had received my two Bachelor of Science degrees with high honors in both the [EEE](http://eee.metu.edu.tr/) and [Physics](http://www.physics.metu.edu.tr/) departments from METU. My research interests include but are not limited to computer vision, deep metric learning, and remote sensing.
